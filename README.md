# Data Structures and Algorithms in C#  

This repository is a collection of algorithms, data structures and coding challenges which I've solved over a period of time. The algorithms/solutions are implemented considering effecient Time and Space Complexity approaches. All the solutions are 100% correct and tested against various test cases, unless marked as TODO/InProgress.
